# Suffix tree Ukkonnen algorithm
This code creates a suffix tree from given string $S$ using $\mathcal{O}(|S|)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(|S|)$ memory via Ukkonen algorithm. Every path from root in suffix tree corresponds to some substring in $S$ (using condensed edges). 

Suffix tree is in many ways analogous to suffix array and is the most powerful took for strings processing. This looks miraculous that such a structure can be built in just a linear time.
